# CICD-Jenkins-Projects
This Repository consists of projects related to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). These projects were developed as part of my learning journey with **Jenkins**, a popular automation tool widely used in the DevOps community.

The main purpose of this repository is to document my progress and understanding of CI/CD concepts through practical implementation. Each project serves as a hands-on exercise to reinforce my knowledge and skills in using Jenkins for automation and deployment.
